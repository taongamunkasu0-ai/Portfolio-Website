## Question 1:  Website Creation 
I  created a personal portfolio website that showcases my background as a student in web development.The content includes:
* "About Me" section with a brief biography,an image of myself (placeholder),and highlighted achievements.
* "Skills" section with ordered and unordered lists of technical and soft skills.
* "Contacts" section with a form for visitors to send messages.
* Navigation menu,header,aside for quotes, and footer with copyright info.
The website is structured semantically with clear sections for better accessibility and organization.
## Question 2:  HTML Elements
### 1.  Challenging elements 
The 5 elements that were challenging to implement are:
* 'form': Requires handling user input and validation.
*  'nav': Needs proper linking and structuring for navigation.
*   'img': Ensuring images are properly sized,formatted, and accessible.
*   'meta': Understanding various meta tags for SEO and responsiveness.
*   'header': Creating a visualy appealing and functionality header section.
### 2.  Semantic elements usage
* Semantic elements like 'header', 'section', 'nav', and 'footer' were used to structure content, making the website more accessible and SEO-friendly.
### 3. Most useful element for layout 
* The 'section' element was useful for organizing the layout because it helps divide content info thematic sections like "About Me" and "Contact"
## Question 4:Development Process 
### 1. Planning structure
The website structure was planned with sectins for header, about, contact, and footer, outlining content flow before coding.
### 2. Testing & debugging HTML
HTML was tested using browser developer tools and validated with W3C Markup Validation Service for errors.
## Question 5.  Git & GitHub Implementation 
### 1. Git commands 
Git commands like 'git init', 'git add', 'git commit', and 'git push' would be used for version control.
### 2.  Commits & message strategy 
Commits would  have messages like "Add header" or "Implement contact form" for tracking changes.
### 3.  Version control importance
Version control is important for tracking changes and managing project updates efficiently.
## Question 6:  Code Quality & Best Practices
### 1.  HTML validation 
HTML can be validated using W3C Markup Validation Service to ensure it's error-free.
### 2.  Best Practices 
Best practices followed include using semantic HTML, proper indentation , and separating content (HTML).
